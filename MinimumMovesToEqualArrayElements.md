### MInimum Moves to Equals Array Elements
Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

* 给定大小为n的非空整数数组，找到使所有数组元素相等所需的最小移动数，其中移动将n-1个元素递增1
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
